--The total number of players who joined that day--
--Of the players who joined, how many were retained--
--The fractional retention (the third column divided by the second column).--


***Q1: Is 30-day rolling retention increasing or decreasing over the lifecycle of the game?***
```

***Q2: Do players with rolling 30-day retention come from specific regions?***

***Q3:Does people retained or not retained has more winning games?***
