# Mobile-App-retention-calculation
Let's get some background!
We've been hired by a mobile gaming company and on the one-year anniversary, we've been tasked with investigating the player retention to learn how our mobile game has performed this past year. The tools we had at our disposal were BigQuery and Google Sheets.

For our investigation we were provided with:

Match information, including the players who matched against each other, and the outcome
Player information, including information like the player's age and when they joined****
